===========

<h2>Building a 21st Century Government</h2>

This project is for the web site "Code4Huntsville" development 

Our Open source prototype project is now on **Heroku**<br>
**[Code4Huntsville.org] (http://code4huntsville.org)**<p>

<i><b>This open source project for coders is looking for project team members.</b></i>  

We are specifically interested in attracting developers who would like to contribute in the following areas:

* Being project leads and being a part of the **Code4Huntsville** leadership team
* Coders interested in building civic applications using open data sources
* Programming APIs and WEB Services for open data sources
* CSS abstraction for allowing designers to create their own design and interfaces
* Architects to help design modular components for building community Web Applications

The general philosophy, though not in much in evidence currently, is to build (and refactor towards) "simple functions" that work together to provide a lot of functionality -  Watch this video! ["Simple Made Easy"] (http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy)
