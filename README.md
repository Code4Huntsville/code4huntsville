Code4Huntsville
===========

<h2>Building a 21st Century Government</h2>

This project is for the web site "Code4Huntsville" development 

Our Open source prototype project is now on **Heroku**<br>
**[Code4Huntsville.org] (http://code4huntsville.org)**<p>

<i><b>This open source project for coders is looking for project team members.</b></i>  

We are specifically interested in attracting developers who would like to contribute in the following areas:

* Programming APIs so this project can be part of custom software solutions
* CSS abstraction for allowing designers to create their own design and interfaces
* Architects to help design modular components for building community Web Applications

The general philosophy, though not in much in evidence currently, is to build (and refactor towards) "simple functions" that work together to provide a lot of functionality -  Watch this video! ["Simple Made Easy"] (http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy)



//Be sure to read [Hatchers-Vision in the git wiki] (https://github.com/RocketHatch/hatchersWeb/wiki/Hatchers-Vision).

If you are interested in being a part of this project contact, Larry Mason @ larry.mason@code4huntsville.org or Chris Beaman @ Chris.beaman@code4huntsville.org.
 
<h3>But most of all we look forward to working with you to help "build local community, with 21st Century Technology!"</h3>
